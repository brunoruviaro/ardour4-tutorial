The **Meter** determines the musical speed of the passage we are
composing, as measured in **Beats Per Minute**.

If we are composing something which is rhythmic, it will also determine the lengths of the
sound samples we use to some extent. So it is important to be able to
set up the Meter before we continue.

To see the meter-related timelines for our session, we can right-click
anywhere in the "header" of the Rulers and check the following options: **Meter**, **Bars & Beats**, and **Tempo**.

It is possible to set a **Meter** and **Tempo** for the entire Ardour
session, as well as to change them at different points in the same
session. In order to do this, locate the Meter section of the **Timeline
Bar** in the Editor Window, and right-click on the first small red mark
to open the **Meter Dialog**.

![Meter dialog]({{ site.url }}/images/Ardour4_Edit_Meter_dialog.png) 

Here you can enter new values for the **Beats Per Bar** as well as the
**Note Value**. Click "*Apply*" to apply the changes globally to your
session.

Then, locate the first red mark in the **Tempo** section, right-click on
it, and choose the BPM (**Beats Per Minute**) for your session.

If the Meter or Tempo of your session changes later in the song or
composition, simply add a new marker by right-clicking in the Meter or
Tempo timeline and selecting **New Tempo** or **New Meter** and entering
the new Tempo or Meter in the resulting dialog.

Next, we will explore **Using Ranges** to set up a loop we can listen to
while we arrange the rhythm.
