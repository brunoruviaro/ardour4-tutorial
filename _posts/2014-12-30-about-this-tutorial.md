This tutorial provides a beginner's introduction to using Ardour for basic sound recording and editing
tasks. It assumes you already have Ardour up and running on your computer. Please note that this tutorial does not (yet) cover any MIDI functionality.

For information on how to install Ardour on Linux and Mac OS X, please visit [https://ardour.org/requirements.html](https://ardour.org/requirements.html). If using Linux, distributions such as [KXStudio](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/) and [UbuntuStudio](http://ubuntustudio.org/) offer a wide selection of useful music software, including Ardour.

The remainder of this page includes **Credits** and **Conventions Used in This Text**.



## Credits

The main body of the manual was written during a **Book Sprint**
led by Derek Holzer in the moddr_lab
([http://moddr.net](http://moddr.net "moddr_lab @ WORM, Rotterdam")) at
WORM in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 23 and 27 November 2009,
with input and support from the international community of Ardour users
and developers. The tutorial was originally written for Ardour 2.X versions. The original FLOSS manual can be found at [http://en.flossmanuals.net/ardour/](http://en.flossmanuals.net/ardour/).

In December 2014, the tutorial was updated for Ardour 3.5 and moved to GitHub. The text was completely revised, and screenshots were replaced with newer ones. In August 2015, a similar revision was made to update all screenshots and text to Ardour 4.2. The 2014 and 2015 revisions were made by Bruno Ruviaro.

The Ardour community is invited to contribute content to this tutorial.
All text and image files live in [https://github.com/brunoruviaro/ardour4-tutorial](https://github.com/brunoruviaro/ardour4-tutorial), which makes it easy for anyone to fork, revise, and remix this text.

This FLOSS manual complements the Ardour reference manual currently
under development by the Ardour community, which aims to provide an
encyclopedic listing of Ardour's features. That reference manual can be
found at [http://manual.ardour.org/](http://manual.ardour.org/).

## Conventions Used in This Text

Below are some basic conventions we have adopted in this manual.

### Mouse Clicks

Ardour requires a two-button mouse to run (or the emulation of that on
your system in some other way). A **Click** is assumed to be a left
button mouse click. A **Right Click** refers to the right-hand button on
the mouse. A *"Control"*, *"Cmd"* or *"Apple"* key pressed with a mouse
Click is not the same, and may in fact give a different result.

### Key Names & Combinations

The names of keys to be pressed are written in quotation marks and
italicised, like this:

*"Control", "Return", "Backspace", "R"*

Key combinations are written like this:

*"Control" + "X"*

or

*"Apple" + "X"*

### Menu Navigation

Many functions are accessible in Ardour by clicking on the various menu
items. Additionally you may need to access functions through the menus
of OS X, Ubuntu, or other Linux distributions. To illustrate this we use
two conventions: the first is illustration via screenshots (images), and
the second is through a **Syntax** like this :

*View > Zoom > Zoom to Session*

The above example is shorthand for "first click on the View menu, then
choose the Zoom item of the list, and then click on Zoom to Session".

### Glossary Words

This tutorial does not assume any previous knowledge of computers or
audio editing, so terms which might be unfamiliar to the general reader
are capitalized throughout this manual, and are listed in **Boldface**
the first time they are used in a chapter. Glossary words are also
defined in-line the first time they occur in the manual, and are
included in the **Glossary** at the end of this manual.
