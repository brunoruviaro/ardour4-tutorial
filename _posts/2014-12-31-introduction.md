**Ardour** is a professional, full-featured hard disk recorder
and Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Ardour is Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

It features unlimited audio tracks and buses, non-destructive, non-linear
editing with unlimited undo, and anything-to-anywhere signal routing. It
supports standard file formats, such as BWF, WAV, WAV64, AIFF and CAF,
and it can use LADSPA, LV2, VST and AudioUnit plugin formats.

Ardour runs on Linux and Mac OS X (for Windows, read [this](http://ardour.org/windows.html)), and uses the **Jack Audio Connection
Kit** (**JACK**) to interface with the computer's sound card, as well as
with other audio applications running on the same system.
